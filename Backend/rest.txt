1. Response should be same irresepective of req platform
2. Routes should be on the basis of nouns and not verbs eg."/user" and not "/getUser"
3. Should use HTTP methods on the routes(HTTP methods are verbs like 'get','post','delete',etc.)
4. Data should be in JSON format
5. APIs should be stateless


Why REST APIs?
1. 95% use REST APIs
2. Community Support
